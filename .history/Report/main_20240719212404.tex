% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
Galaxies at low redshift ($z<0.08$ for the data used here) display a bimodality in their specific star formation rate (sSFR). This phenomenon is related to several factors, including (1) the accretion processes that drive galaxy growth, (2) the feedback processes that eject gas from galaxies, and (3) the interactions between galaxies and their surrounding environment. These processes are strongly influenced by key physical properties of galaxies, such as gas mass, stellar mass, and age. Therefore, it is possible to build models that describe the time evolution of sSFR based on these simple quantities. \\
We developed two very simple analytical models, based on strong assumptions, and applied them to a subset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) dataset. Our findings indicate that young, actively star-forming galaxies can be described by an open-box model, while old, passive galaxies are better represented by a closed-box model, which does not exchange gas with the surrounding halo. We also relaxed some assumptions, such as redshift-independent gas accretion, by numerically integrating the differential equation of the open-box model over infinitesimal time steps, obtaining similar results.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Galaxies are the fundamental building blocks of the universe at cosmological scales. Therefore, understanding how they form, evolve over time, and interact to create more complex structures is crucial. However, capturing their extreme diversity within a mathematical model is a very challenging task.

In this context, it is well known \citep[e.g.,][]{Kauffmann_2003} that two main populations can be identified in the plane of \textbf{specific star formation rate} (sSFR) versus \textbf{stellar mass} ($M_{\text{star}}$): one of young, actively star-forming galaxies (the \textit{main sequence}) and the other of old, mostly passive galaxies, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mass_sSFR}. For this reason, a model which relates sSFR and $M_{\text{star}}$ should have at least two regimes, with a sharp transition past some threshold. In this work, we investigate the processes that either stimulate or quench the formation of new stars within galaxies at low redshift, and we try to develop simple mathematical models to test our assumptions.

The raw material for star formation is gas, which, under appropriate conditions, can collapse and form a virialized object. The amount of gas within a galaxy is not constant and is subject to a myriad of processes that depend on the main physical properties of the galaxy, such as age and mass. Therefore, we expect sSFR to drop whenever the consumed gas is no longer replaced by new gas, coming either from stars (winds, supernovae) or from outside the galaxy.

The black dashed line indicates the value where the sSFR distribution has a local minimum, which is used to separate the main sequence from quiescent galaxies. The 25, 50, 75, and 95\% contours of both populations are shown.}
