%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% Allow "Thomas van Noord" and "Simon de Laguarde" and alike to be sorted by "N" and "L" etc. in the bibliography.
% Write the name in the bibliography as "\VAN{Noord}{Van}{van} Noord, Thomas"
\DeclareRobustCommand{\VAN}[3]{#2}
\let\VANthebibliography\thebibliography
\def\thebibliography{\DeclareRobustCommand{\VAN}[3]{##3}\VANthebibliography}


%%%%% AUTHORS - PLACE YOUR OWN PACKAGES HERE %%%%%
\usepackage{placeins} %Fede says it's useful

% Only include extra packages if you really need them. Avoid using amssymb if newtxmath is enabled, as these packages can cause conflicts. newtxmatch covers the same math symbols while producing a consistent Times New Roman font. Common packages are:
\usepackage{graphicx}	% Including figure files
\usepackage{amsmath}	% Advanced maths commands

%%%%% AUTHORS - PLACE YOUR OWN COMMANDS HERE %%%%%

\newcommand{\milan}{{Dipartimento di Fisica ``G. Occhialini'', Universit\'a degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Piazza della Scienza 3, 20126 Milano, Italy}}

% Please keep new commands to a minimum, and use \newcommand not \def to avoid
% overwriting existing commands. Example:
%\newcommand{\pcm}{\,cm$^{-2}$}	% per cm-squared

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TITLE PAGE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Title of the paper, and the short title which is used in the headers.

% The list of authors, and the short list which is used in the headers.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

\textbf{OUR QUESTION WAS: What are the physical processes that determine the \textbf{quenching of the sSFR} for a fraction of the more \textbf{massive galaxies}? Is the development of such processes related to the \textbf{age} of the galaxy?}

There is bimodality in sSFR vs mass plot
\cite{kauffmann_host_2003}

I want to search for a model that takes into account both active and passive galaxies

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Material (SDSS and Cigale)}

\subsection{Theoretical frameworks.... }

\subsection{Models to test}
closed box, open box, mixed..



\subsection{Maths}
\label{sec:maths} % used for referring to this section from elsewhere

Simple mathematics can be inserted into the flow of the text e.g. $2\times3=6$
or $v=220$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, but more complicated expressions should be entered
as a numbered equation:

\begin{equation}
    x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
	\label{eq:quadratic}
\end{equation}

Refer back to them as e.g. equation~(\ref{eq:quadratic}).

\subsection{Figures and tables}

Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text. Don't
worry about the exact layout, which will be handled by the publishers.

Figures are referred to as e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:example_figure}, and tables as
e.g. Table~\ref{tab:example_table}.

% Example figure
\begin{figure}
	% To include a figure from a file named example.*
	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{example}
    \caption{This is an example figure. Captions appear below each figure.
	Give enough detail for the reader to understand what they're looking at,
	but leave detailed discussion to the main body of the text.}
    \label{fig:example_figure}
\end{figure}

% Example table
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{This is an example table. Captions appear above each table.
	Remember to define the quantities, symbols and units used.}
	\label{tab:example_table}
	\begin{tabular}{lccr} % four columns, alignment for each
		\hline
		A & B & C & D\\
		\hline
		1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
		2 & 4 & 6 & 8\\
		3 & 5 & 7 & 9\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section{Discussion}

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% REFERENCES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The best way to enter references is to use BibTeX:

\bibliographystyle{mnras}
\bibliography{report} % if your bibtex file is called example.bib


% Alternatively you could enter them by hand, like this:
% This method is tedious and prone to error if you have lots of references
%\begin{thebibliography}{99}
%\bibitem[\protect\citeauthoryear{Author}{2012}]{Author2012}
%Author A.~N., 2013, Journal of Improbable Astronomy, 1, 1

%Others S., 2012, Journal of Interesting Stuff, 17, 198

\section{Some extra material}

If you want to present additional material which would interrupt the flow of the main paper,
it can be placed in an Appendix which appears after the list of references.
