	abstract = {We present the public data release of halo and galaxy catalogues extracted from the eagle suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. These simulations were performed with an enhanced version of the gadget code that includes a modified hydrodynamics solver, time-step limiter and subgrid treatments of baryonic physics, such as stellar mass loss, element-by-element radiative cooling, star formation and feedback from star formation and black hole accretion. The simulation suite includes runs performed in volumes ranging from 25 to 100 comoving megaparsecs per side, with numerical resolution chosen to marginally resolve the Jeans mass of the gas at the star formation threshold. The free parameters of the subgrid models for feedback are calibrated to the redshift z=0 galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes and black hole mass–stellar mass relation. The simulations have been shown to match a wide range of observations for present-day and higher-redshift galaxies. The raw particle data have been used to link galaxies across redshifts by creating merger trees. The indexing of the tree produces a simple way to connect a galaxy at one redshift to its progenitors at higher redshift and to identify its descendants at lower redshift. In this paper we present a relational database which we are making available for general use. A large number of properties of haloes and galaxies and their merger trees are stored in the database, including stellar masses, star formation rates, metallicities, photometric measurements and mock gri images. Complex queries can be created to explore the evolution of more than 105 galaxies, examples of which are provided in the Appendix. The relatively good and broad agreement of the simulations with a wide range of observational datasets makes the database an ideal resource for the analysis of model galaxies through time, and for connecting and interpreting observational datasets.},

We focus on the luminosity of the [O iii]λ5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[O iii]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong Hδ absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [O iii] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [O iii] luminosities.},

	abstract = {Using the cosmological baryonic accretion rate and normal star formation (SF) efﬁciencies, we present a very simple model for star-forming galaxies that accounts for the mass and redshift dependences of the star formation rate (SFR)–mass and Tully–Fisher (TF) relations from z ∼ 2 to the present. The time evolution follows from the fact that each modeled galaxy approaches a steady state where the SFR follows the (net) cold gas accretion rate. The key feature of the model is a halo mass ﬂoor Mmin 1011 M below which accretion is quenched in order to simultaneously account for the observed slopes of the SFR–mass and TF relations. The same successes cannot be achieved via an SF threshold (or delay) nor by varying the SF efﬁciency or the feedback efﬁciency. Combined with the mass ceiling for cold accretion due to virial shock heating, the mass ﬂoor Mmin explains galaxy “downsizing,” where more massive galaxies formed earlier and over a shorter period of time. It turns out that the model also accounts for the observed galactic baryon and gas fractions as a function of mass and time, and the cosmic SFR density, which are all resulting from the mass ﬂoor Mmin. The model helps us to understand that it is the cosmological decline of accretion rate that drives the decrease of cosmic SFR density between z ∼ 2 and z = 0 and the rise of the cosmic SFR density from z ∼ 6 to z ∼ 2 that allows us to put a constraint on our main parameter Mmin 1011 M . Among the physical mechanisms that could be responsible for the mass ﬂoor, our view is that photoionization feedback (from ﬁrst in situ hot stars) lowering the cooling efﬁciency is likely to play a large role.},

	abstract = {We present an analytic formalism that describes the evolution of the stellar, gas and metal content of galaxies. It is based on the idea, inspired by hydrodynamic simulations, that galaxies live in a slowly evolving equilibrium between inflow, outflow and star formation. We argue that this formalism broadly captures the behaviour of galaxy properties evolving in simulations. The resulting equilibrium equations for the star formation rate, gas fraction and metallicity depend on three key free parameters that represent ejective feedback, preventive feedback and reaccretion of ejected material. We schematically describe how these parameters are constrained by models and observations. Galaxies perturbed off the equilibrium relations owing to inflow stochasticity tend to be driven back towards equilibrium, such that deviations in star formation rate at a given mass are correlated with gas fraction and anticorrelated with metallicity. After an early gas accumulation epoch, quiescently star-forming galaxies are expected to be in equilibrium over most of cosmic time. The equilibrium model provides a simple intuitive framework for understanding the cosmic evolution of galaxy properties, and centrally features the cycle of baryons between galaxies and surrounding gas as the driver of galaxy growth.},

	abstract = {A very simple physical model of galaxies is one in which the formation of stars is instantaneously regulated by the mass of gas in a reservoir with mass loss scaling with the star-formation rate (SFR). This model links together three different aspects of the evolving galaxy population: (1) the cosmic time evolution of the specific star-formation rate (sSFR) relative to the growth of halos, (2) the gas-phase metallicities across the galaxy population and over cosmic time, and (3) the ratio of the stellar to dark matter mass of halos. The gas regulator is defined by the gas consumption timescale (ɛ-1) and the mass loading λ of the wind outflow λ·SFR. The simplest regulator, in which ɛ and λ are constant, sets the sSFR equal to exactly the specific accretion rate of the galaxy; more realistic situations lead to an sSFR that is perturbed from this precise relation. Because the gas consumption timescale is shorter than the timescale on which the system evolves, the metallicity Z is set primarily by the instantaneous operation of the regulator system rather than by the past history of the system. The metallicity of the gas reservoir depends on ɛ, λ, and sSFR, and the regulator system therefore naturally produces a Z(m star, SFR) relation if ɛ and λ depend on the stellar mass m star. Furthermore, this relation will be the same at all epochs unless the parameters ɛ and λ themselves change with time. A so-called fundamental metallicity relation is naturally produced by these conditions. The overall mass-metallicity relation Z(m star) directly provides the fraction f star(m star) of incoming baryons that are being transformed into stars. The observed Z(m star) relation of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies implies a strong dependence of stellar mass on halo mass that reconciles the different faint-end slopes of the stellar and halo mass functions in standard ΛCDM models. The observed relation also boosts the sSFR relative to the specific accretion rate and produces a different dependence on mass, both of which are observed. The derived Z(m star, SFR) relation for the regulator system is fit to published Z(m star, SFR) data for the SDSS galaxy population, yielding ɛ and λ as functions of m star. The fitted ɛ is consistent with observed molecular gas-depletion timescales in galaxies (allowing for the extra atomic gas), while the fitted λ is also reasonable. The gas-regulator model also successfully reproduces the Z(m star) metallicities of star-forming galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 2. One consequence of this analysis is that it suggests that the m star-m halo relation is established by baryonic processes operating within galaxies, and that a significant fraction (40\%) of baryons coming into the halos are being processed through the galaxies. This fraction may be more or less constant. The success of the gas-regulator model in simultaneously explaining many diverse observed relations over the 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2 interval suggests that the evolution of galaxies is governed by simple physics that form the basis for this model.},

The paper also collects observational evidence for gas accretion sustaining star formation. It reviews evidence inferred from neutral and ionized hydrogen, as well as from stars. A number of properties characterizing large samples of star-forming galaxies can be explained by metal-poor gas accretion, in particular, the relationship among stellar mass, metallicity, and star-formation rate (the so-called fundamental metallicity relationship). They are put forward and analyzed. Theory predicts gas accretion to be particularly important at high redshift, so indications based on distant objects are reviewed, including the global star-formation history of the universe, and the gas around galaxies as inferred from absorption features in the spectra of background sources.},

	abstract = {We extend the phenomenological study of the evolving galaxy population of Peng et al. (2010) to the central/satellite dichotomy in Yang et al. Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) groups. We find that satellite galaxies are responsible for all the environmental effects in our earlier work. The fraction of centrals that are red does not depend on their environment but only on their stellar masses, whereas that of the satellites depends on both. We define a relative satellite quenching efficiency ɛsat, which is the fraction of blue centrals that are quenched upon becoming the satellite of another galaxy. This is shown to be independent of stellar mass, but to depend strongly on local overdensity, δ, ranging between 0.2 and at least 0.8. The red fraction of satellites correlate much better with the local overdensity δ, a measure of location within the group, than with the richness of the group, i.e., dark matter halo mass. This, and the fact that satellite quenching depends on local density and not on either the stellar mass of the galaxy or the dark matter halo mass, gives clues as to the nature of the satellite-quenching process. We furthermore show that the action of mass quenching on satellite galaxies is also independent of the dark matter mass of the parent halo. We then apply the Peng et al. approach to predict the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies, split into passive and active galaxies, and show that these match very well the observed mass functions from SDSS, further strengthening the validity of this phenomenological approach. We highlight the fact that the observed M* is exactly the same for the star-forming centrals and satellites and the observed M* for the star-forming satellites is independent of halo mass above 1012 M ⊙, which emphasizes the universality of the mass-quenching process that we identified in Peng et al. Post-quenching merging modifies the mass function of the central galaxies but can increase the mass of typical centrals by only about 25\%.},

Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wavebands and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at lambda{\textgreater}40 micron. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T{\textasciitilde}40-55 K (warm dust) and T{\textasciitilde}20-23 K (cool dust), and with a dust emissivity index epsilon=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60\% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to {\textasciitilde}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 micron and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 micron is {\textasciitilde}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. The FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-nearIR stellar emission is within a factor {\textasciitilde}2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20\% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z{\textgreater}1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in sub-mm surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.},

	abstract = {We address the origin of the robust bi-modality observed in galaxy properties about a characteristic stellar mass {\textasciitilde}3x10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}Msun. Less massive galaxies tend to be ungrouped blue star-forming discs, while more massive galaxies are typically grouped red old-star spheroids. Colour-magnitude data show a gap between the red and blue sequences, extremely red luminous galaxies already at z{\textasciitilde}1, a truncation of today's blue sequence above L\_*, and massive starbursts at z{\textasciitilde}2-4. We propose that these features are driven by the thermal properties of the inflowing gas and their interplay with the clustering and feedback processes, all functions of the dark-matter halo mass and associated with a similar characteristic scale. In haloes below a critical shock-heating mass M\_shock{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}Msun, discs are built by cold streams, not heated by a virial shock, yielding efficient early star formation. It is regulated by supernova feedback into a long sequence of bursts in blue galaxies constrained to a "fundamental line". Cold streams penetrating through hot media in M{\textgreater}M\_shock haloes preferentially at z{\textgreater}2 lead to massive starbursts in L{\textgreater}L\_* galaxies. At z{\textless}2, in M{\textgreater}M\_shock haloes hosting groups, the gas is heated by a virial shock, and being dilute it becomes vulnerable to feedback from energetic sources such as AGNs. This shuts off gas supply and prevents further star formation, leading by passive evolution to "red-and-dead" massive spheroids starting at z{\textasciitilde}1. A minimum in feedback efficiency near M\_shock explains the observed minimum in M/L and the qualitative features of the star-formation history. The cold flows provide a hint for solving the angular-momentum problem. When these processes are incorporated in simulations they recover the main bi-modality features and solve other open puzzles.},

	abstract = {By compiling a comprehensive census of literature studies, we investigate the evolution of the Main Sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the widest range of redshift (\$0 {\textless} z {\textless} 6\$) and stellar mass (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{8.5\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5\}\$ \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) ever probed. We convert all observations to a common calibration and find a remarkable consensus on the variation of the MS shape and normalization across cosmic time. The relation exhibits a curvature towards the high stellar masses at all redshifts. The best functional form is governed by two parameters: the evolution of the normalization and the turnover mass (\$M\_0(t)\$), which both evolve as a power law of the Universe age. The turn-over mass determines the MS shape. It marginally evolves with time, making the MS slightly steeper towards \$z{\textbackslash}sim4-6\$. At stellar masses below \$M\_0(t)\$, SFGs have a constant specific SFR (sSFR), while above \$M\_0(t)\$ the sSFR is suppressed. We find that the MS is dominated by central galaxies. This allows to turn \$M\_0(t)\$ into the corresponding host halo mass. This evolves as the halo mass threshold between cold and hot accretion regimes, as predicted by the theory of accretion, where the central galaxy is fed or starved of cold gas supply, respectively. We, thus, argue that the progressive MS bending as a function of the Universe age is caused by the lower availability of cold gas in halos entering the hot accretion phase, in addition to black hole feedback. We also find qualitatively the same trend in the largest sample of star-forming galaxies provided by the IllustrisTNG simulation. Nevertheless, we still note large quantitative discrepancies with respect to observations, in particular at the high mass end. These can not be easily ascribed to biases or systematics in the observed SFRs and the derived MS.},

	title = {The {Star} {Formation} {Rate} bi-modality in galaxies at low redshift},
	abstract = {My colleagues and I have investigated the presence of two different populations of galaxies in the star formation rate-stellar mass plane using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data at redshift 𝑧 ∼ 0. After having worked with different catalogues, we have inferred that the presence of a main star-forming sequence and of a passive one could be explained by considering galaxies as open systems with different feedback processes which slow down the star formation at high stellar masses, for instance the presence of Active Galactic Nuclei. In this framework the star formation rate depends mainly on the inflow of gas from the outer environment, and this process overall stops when a maximum dark matter halo mass of 𝑀ℎ𝑎𝑙𝑜 ∼ 1012 − 1013 𝑀⊙ is reached. This mechanism is able to explain the generally higher masses of passive galaxies with respect to the ones on the main sequence.},

	title = {Laboratory of {Data} {Analysis} - {The} specific star formation rate populations},
	abstract = {Using simple models and empirical laws, we present some possible descriptions of the two galaxies populations we observe: star-forming galaxies and passive galaxies. We focus on the specific star formation rate (sSFR) vs stellar mass relation and on the physical process leading to sSFR quenching for a fraction of the massive galaxies. We work using photometry data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) processed by the CIGALE code. Our results rely on three main models: the Open-box, the Closed-box and the numerically evolved model of a galaxy. The Open-box solution is a fairly good representation of our data for star-forming galaxies, while the Closed-box model roughly captures the properties of the sSFR of passive galaxies. We believe that the numerical approach should be preferred over the others, even though our implementation suffers a relevant discrepancy in magnitude from our data. Ineffective gas cooling due to galaxies haloes growth plays a key role in determining the transition from the star-forming regime to the passive one. Our estimate of the stellar mass threshold between the two regimes seems reasonable for our simple description. The non-numerical approaches might be valid as well, but a deeper refinement of such models is necessary.},

	title = {The star formation rate bimodality in galaxies at low redshift},
	abstract = {In this work we treat the evolution of galaxies and the star formation process, focusing in particular on the question: which physical processes determine a bimodality in the star formation rate distribution? In order to answer to this question, we have studied data at low redshift 𝑧 ≲ 0.3, measured in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and simulated in the Eagle Simulation. We noticed that the star formation rate is strictly related to the gas mass of galaxies, therefore we built three different analytical models describing the gas mass variation. We took into account different processes that contribute to the inflow and the outflow of gas, under the assumption that galaxies are composed only by dark matter, stars and gas. From our studies emerged that galaxies are open systems exchanging gas with the surrounding environment. Moreover, the star formation process is strongly influenced by the accretion of gas on the galaxy, driven by the gravitational potential of the halo.},
